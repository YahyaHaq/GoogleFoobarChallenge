# GoogleFoobarChallenge
Google Foobar challenge used to be googles secret hiring process. Google used to take note of your search history and based upon that it invited you take part 
in these fun but challenging problems. Previously Google used to send out an job invitation for all those who could pass level 3 but in recent years
stopped hiring using Foobar. Nevertheless i wanted to test my skills and was in the mood for a good challenge. I could only solve upto level 4( level 5 
way to intense. maybe next time XD )

If anyone wants to take a go at these questions ive added the problem description in the readme files
